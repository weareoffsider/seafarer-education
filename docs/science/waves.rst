Waves
===========================================

The science of Mechanical and Electromagnetic waves support a range of Maritime equipment and concepts, and as such a basic understanding is key to working through other concepts.

Waves carry energy from one place to another. Mechanical waves do do so through a medium of air, liquid, or solid. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium, can travel in vacuum, and in fact are obstructed by air, liquid, and solid matter to varying degrees.

We can describe waves using graphs that depict high points (crests), mid points (resting position), low points (trough), and how the wave alters over time.

The **amplitude** is the distance from resting position to the crest.

The **period** is how long it takes for the wave to go through one cycle (crest to crest or trough to trough).

The **frequency** is the number of times that a period fits in to 1 second. This is measured in Hertz, so 1Hz means one period per second. 1000Hz (or a kilohertz - 1KHz) would mean one thousand periods per second.


Propagation
--------------

All the above concepts consider time and amplitude only, but there's one last major consideration, waves travel through space. This is called **propagation**, and the speed of propagation is the **velocity** of the wave.

For mechanical waves, this speed is dependant on the medium the wave is travelling through, as they cannot travel without a medium. For electromagnetic waves, they travel at 300,000,000 metres per second in vacuum, and slow down when travelling through airs, liquids, and solids.

The **wavelength** is the distance between two crests or troughs, travelling at that speed.

If the **frequency** and **velocity** is known you can calculate the wave length.

Doppler Effect
----------------

When the transmitter of a wave is moving, it effectively pushes the wavelengths smaller in the direction of travel, and enlarges the wavelengths away from the direction of travel. Anything that is moving the same speed as the transmitter won't see a difference, but everything else will see a shift in frequency - higher when the distance is closing, lower when the distance is opening.

This is heard regularly on the road, especially with sirens from emergency vehicles - the sound as they approach is higher than the sound once they've passed.
