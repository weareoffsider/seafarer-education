Mechanical Waves
=================

These waves involve a transfer of energy through a medium. The most relevant to the mariner are sound waves and the actual waves on the water.




Mechanical Waves for Mariners
------------------------------

The ocean we operate upon is constantly subjected to mechanical waves, forces that are created and then travel upon the surface of the water, manifesting as sea and swell.

Some of our technologies make use of the predictable aspects of mechanical waves to measure distance and speed.

Echo Sounder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Marine Echo Sounder transmits sound energy in to the water, and then measures how long it takes for the sound to return.

Doppler Logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Doppler Logs make use of the doppler effect in acoustic energy waves to measure the speed of the ship.
