The Shipping Container
=======================

An Intermodal Shipping Container is one that complies with a particular standard: ISO 6346. The standard specifies sizing, coding, identification and marking of these containers.

Standard containers are 8 feet (2.43m) wide, 8.5 feet (2.59m) tall and are either 20 (6.06m) or 40 (12.2m) feet long. There are other lengths, but they are less amenable to standardised handling, and 20/40 feet represents around 90% of the world's shipping containers.

Shipping Container Types
-------------------------
Within the standardised dimensions there are a number of different types of shipping containers for different types of cargo.

- General Purpose Shipping Container
- Dangerous Goods Shipping Container
- Refrigerated Shipping Container
- Insulated Shipping Container
- Open Top Shipping Container
- Side Opening Shipping Container
- Flat Rack Shipping Container
