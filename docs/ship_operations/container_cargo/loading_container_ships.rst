Loading Container Ships
========================

Container Terminals and Shore Side Operations have a large role in the loading of modern container ships. Delivery, Planning, and Crane Operation is handled by the shore side, as large containers ships rarely have the equipment required to handle shipping containers. The reason for this is efficiency, a well managed container terminal can ensure all stages of the loading operation are done as quickly as possible:

- vessel berthing and unberthing
- container delivery to the terminal
- crane loading on to the vessel

Planning
---------------

On shore planners are responsible for creating the initial loading plan, in accordance with regulations for cargo stowage that ensure dangerous goods are properly separated, and that the stability of the vessel is not compromised.

This initial plan is cross-checked and verified by the master, and either confirmed or returned with changes required. Once the initial plan has been finalised, the Chief Mate is responsible for a final loading plan which takes into account what order holds should be loaded in, and the division of ship and shore labour for securing containers - to ensure the vessel is not stressed unduly by the partially loaded cargo, and the staff can operate in an efficient manner.

Arrival
--------------
Pre-arrival checklists and reporting obligations to the container terminal are fulfilled by the Master and the vessel's shore operation staff. The vessel berths and then loads as per the plan.

Loading
---------------
The container terminal is responsible for the delivery and loading of containers. On the vessel itself, officers will oversee the loading operation to ensure it is carried out safely, and that mistakes are not made in the loading process such as misplaced containers off the plan, or incorrect stowage that could compromise the security of the containers. Containers will be secured as per the vessel's Cargo Securing Manual.

Departure
-------------
Once documentation is complete, and the final report of the loading operation is completed by the master and shore operation staff, the vessel may sail to its next destination.
