GPS/GNSS
===================

20,200 km altitudes

6 orbital planes x 4 satellites - ensures 4 satellites available to any observer on the Earth.

World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) Datum.
Charts compliant can be directly plotted.

Older charts may require adjustment to match the WGS 84 Datum.


TOA
Multichannel, listening to multiple satellites.

Position spheres (not celestial as it is based on range from satellite)


Dilution of Precision
HDOP & PDOP




Errors
Satellite Clock Stability
Ephemeris Prediction
Ionosphere Delay (low elevation errors)
