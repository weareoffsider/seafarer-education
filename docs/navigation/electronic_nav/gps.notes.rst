GPS/GNSS
===================

20,200 km altitudes

6 orbital planes x 4 satellites - ensures 4 satellites available to any observer on the Earth.

World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) Datum.
Charts compliant can be directly plotted.

Older charts may require adjustment to match the WGS 84 Datum.


TOA
Multichannel, listening to multiple satellites.

Position spheres (not celestial as it is based on range from satellite)


Dilution of Precision
HDOP & PDOP

All on same frequency. Code Division Multiple Access transmission allows this.

Continuously broadcasting on L1 and L2

L1 for course acquisition

Navigation messages broadcast the:
satellite clock
GPS time relationship
ephemeris (satellite orbit) every 2 hours
Almanac (network synopsis and error correction) - improves accuracy against correction ever 24 hours



Errors
Satellite Clock Stability
Ephemeris Prediction
Ionosphere Delay (low elevation errors)
