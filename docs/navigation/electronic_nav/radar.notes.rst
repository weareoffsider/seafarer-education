Radar Notes
===========


High transmission power gives waves a high amplitude, which means they take longer to decay, so they can detect at greater ranges.

Long Wavelengths are less readily absorbed by precipitation, and are determined by the frequency chosen. X Band Radar has a wavelength of 10cm, while S Band Radars have a wavelength of 3cm.

In addition to wave length, pulse length is another factor in detection. The RADAR will transmit for a certain amount of time, and that time determines the pulse length.

.. math::
    \text{Pulse Length(m)} = Time * Speed



Radar Horizon
--------------

The theoretical radar horizon of a transmitter or target in normal atmospheric conditions can be calculated using the following formula [DNBW05]_.

.. math::
    \text{Radar Horizon} = Distance_{nm} = 2.21 \sqrt Height_m

Total horizon is found by using the above formula on the target and transmitter, and adding them together.

.. math::
    \text{Total Distance}_{nm} = 2.21 \sqrt TxHeight_m + 2.21 \sqrt TargetHeight_m

RAdio Detection And Ranging

X Band - 3cm - 9GHz - High Resolution

S Band - 10cm - 3GHz - Low Resolution, greater range, less weather effect, larger.

Short Pulse - Short Range, Accuracy, Range Discrimination
Long Pulse - Ranged, Masking, Less Accurate
