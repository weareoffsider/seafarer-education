Global Navigation Satellite Systems
=====================================

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a collection of systems and technologies that enable users to determine their precise position whereever they are in the world. The most well known GNSS system is the Global Positioning System (GPS), and that will be the focus of this article, but there are other systems in operation today that use the same principles as GPS.

The System
============

Like the name implies, it's not just a single technology but a system comprised of multiple parts. The most prominent part of this system is the space segment.
