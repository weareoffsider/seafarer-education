Mechanical Navigation
========================

A large amount of our marine navigation is done in the context of charts. 2 dimensional pieces of paper that represent a certain part of the world. They are created to very exact specifications by Hydrographic Offices, and allow us to navigate using pencil, protractor, divider and ruler as long as we have working instruments like Compasses, RADAR, and so on. It is important to be well practiced with charts and mechanical methods of navigation, as they are a reliable backup if any of your digital systems go down, as well as a perfectly serviceable means of day to day coastal navigation.
