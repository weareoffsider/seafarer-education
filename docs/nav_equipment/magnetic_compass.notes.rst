Magnetic Compass
===========================

This is a direction finding tool that has the somewhat unique quality these days of requiring no power to operate, nor requiring data from a source outside the vessel. This makes it an essential backup to navigation on the vessel.

Magnetic north is not true north. The magnetic poles are offset from the true poles, and gradually move over the years. Magnetic compasses free of other interference would settle on magnetic north, however they are influenced by metals around them as well.


Vessels in construction
-----------------------

Vessels are typically held in a single direction during construction. The steel that the vessel is made of is sitting at a single angle in relation to the magnetic fields of the Earth, and is also undergoing working and heating and assumes some mostly permanent magnetic properties.


Deviation
-----------

Deviation changes with change in vessel's heading because the relation of the magnet (the ship) turns with the compass.



Compass Error
--------------
Combination of Deviation and Variation.

Error East - Compass Least
Error West - Compass Best



Compass Fluid Mix
------------------
Distilled Water 2:1 Medicinal Alcohol


Requirements
---------------
All ships, properly adjusted standard magnetic compass or other means independant of power supply.

300-500GT must also have an alternative compass (fluxgate, satellite or gyro).

500GT above must have a gyro compass.


Adjustment
-----------
Goal is to have compass deviation of about maximum 1Â° total when they are all summed together.
