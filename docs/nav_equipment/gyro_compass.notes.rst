Gyro Compass
==================




Performance Standards
---------------------




Technical
----------

Spinning wheels create a resistive force, that is, they resist changes in orientation from things applied outside them. This quality means a quickly rotating spin axis will hold it's position despite outside forces. Properly applied this then can be use to maintain a particular direction, for marine navigation we want True North.


1. Balance the Gyro so it parallel to the horizon, done through gyro rotor case design.
2. Settle tilt and drift by correcting for Latitude, tilt max at equator, drift max at poles.

Resistance Means:

Mercury Ballistic provides the torque which keeps it facing North. (viscous liquid staying east west). Gravity can also be used using weights. Torque induced east west movement (rotation of the Earth).

Gyrocompasses only work because we move slow enough not to negate the East-West coriolis force.

Damped gyro reduces adjustments.


Errors
---------
Incorrect Latitude configuration.

Residual Gyro Error
High or Low

Repeaters
----------

Rate of Turn
--------------
Constant radius turns, calculating wheel over points.
Informing Vessel Manoeuvres


.. math::
    RoT(deg/min) = 0.96 * Speed \div Radius

Required for vessels over 50,000 GT
