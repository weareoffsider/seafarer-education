Sextant
======================


Taking an observation
-----------------------
1. Observe one target (horizon, object) through the clear half of the horizon glass, and another through the mirrored side of the glass, adjusting the index arm to get close, and then the micrometer scale til the reflection and target are in line.

2. Read degrees from the position of the index arm arrow on the arc.
3. Read minutes based on the position of zero on the vernier scale in relation to the micrometer scale.
4. Read the seconds based on the position of the nearest mark of the vernier scale in relation to the micrometer scale.


Causes of Observation Inaccurary
--------------------------------
Refraction can be quite pronounced at low altitudes, making the exact altitude observation unreliable. Also, visibility of what you're comparing plays a factor. If the Sea Horizon is not clear, it is not possible to take a sight, although sometimes changing your own height can help (taking the sight from deck rather than an elevated bridge).

Error Adjusting a Sextant
-------------------------

Adjustable Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**1st Adjustment - Perpendicularity Error**

   Set the index arm at halfway across the arc. Look down the index arm (arc furthest away), and observe the index mirror. If correctly adjusted the actual arc will be in line with the reflected arc in the index mirror. If not, readjust the 1st adjustment screw (on the index mirror).


**2nd Adjustment - Side Error**

   Set the index arm close to zero, look through the eyepiece and observe the horizon. Line up the reflected and real horizon and then rocked left and right. If the horizon mirror is correctly adjusted, the reflection and real image should stay aligned, if they become disconnected.

**3rd Adjustment - Parallelism Error**

    This occurs when the two mirrors are not parallel, when the index bar is set to zero exactly. You can check for this by observing anything through the telescope and observing the reflected and real object (horizon, sun, star). Ensure it is exactly clamped to zero and adjust the 3rd adjustment screw til the reflected and real object are in line.

**Old Adjustment - Collimation Error**

    This error is not seen in modern sextants as they are built to prevent it. It occurs when the telescope is not perfectly parallel to the body of the sextant.

Non-adjustable Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Centring Error
2. Prismatic Error
3. Shade Error
4. Graduation Error


Residual Index Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Index Error is the error remaining after performing all possible adjustments. This error should be checked just before all observations so you can factor the Index Error in to your observations. What you are doing here is finding the ACTUAL zero point of your sextant currently.


**Sun Method**

    The most accurate because you can verify your accuracy against the Nautical Almanac. Set the index bar to zero and then adjust the sextant using the micrometer drum so the reflection and the actual sun are just touching and take a reading. Then reverse their positions and take a second reading.

    The difference between them divided by two becomes your index error. On the arc is requires a negative correction while off the arc requires a positive correction.

    The Index Error can be verified, because the total difference between your observations should be exactly 4 diameters of the Sun, a value you can find in the Daily Pages in the Nautical Almanac as SD.


**Star Method**

    Observe a star with the index bar close to zero, and then adjust with the micrometer until the reflected and real star are in alignment. Whereever the sextant reads at that point is your index error. Take it multiple times, going both up to and down to the point of convergence and average out the readings.

**Horizon Method**

    The same as the star method, but with the horizon. This is the least accurate method and should only be used when there is no other alternative.
