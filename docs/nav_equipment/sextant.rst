Sextant
======================

Error Adjusting a Sextant
-------------------------

Adjustable Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Perpendicularity Error

   Set the index arm at halfway across the arc. Look down the index arm (arc furthest away), and observe the index mirror. If correctly adjusted the actual arc will be in line with the reflected arc in the index mirror. If not, readjust the 1st adjustment screw (on the index mirror).

2. Perpendicularity Error


Non-adjustable Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




Taking an observation
-----------------------
1. Observe one target (horizon, object) through the clear half of the horizon glass, and another through the mirrored side of the glass, adjusting the index arm and micrometer scale as appropriate.

2. Read degrees from the position of the index arm arrow on the arc.
3. Read minutes based on the position of zero on the vernier scale in relation to the micrometer scale.
4. Read the seconds based on the position of the nearest mark of the vernier scale in relation to the micrometer scale.
