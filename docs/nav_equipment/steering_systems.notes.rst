Steering Control Systems
===========================

Performance Standards
----------------------
Track Control Needs

Mode of Steering

TO-Waypoint and NEXT-Waypoint
Time and Distance to TO-Waypoint
Next Track Course
Selected Track Information

12 hours before departure test steering gear
3 months emergency steering drill

10,000 Gross Tonne and Upwards


Analog Manual Steering
--------------------------------

Manual Steering
--------------------
Analog Wheel - Ship's wheel directly interacts with rudder system (tiller/rope/hydraulic)
Helm Wheel (follow-up) steering. Helmsman gives helm orders and then the rudder catches up at it's standard turn rate.
Non-Follow-Up steering. Helmsman directly controls rudder motor system, pushing port or starboard. The rudder only moves when it is pushed.


Tracking Control
Heading Control



Autopilot Steering
-----------------------
Position Data
Rate Data
Accumulated Error Data



Automatic Aspects
------------------
Proportional - actual direction

Derivative - rate of change
Integral - overall

Manual Controls
--------------------
Counter Rudder - customise to correct course faster, to high causes oscillations, to low sluggish returns
Permanent Helm - set a known amount of helm for the autopilot to take in to account
Rudder Limit - maximum amount of rudder to use
Weather - deadzone to avoid reacting to rhythmic yaw in sea conditions where early responses would only exacerbate return swings.


Adaptive Autopilot
