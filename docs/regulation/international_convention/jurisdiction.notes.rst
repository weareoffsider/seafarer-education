Jurisdiction
===============

Maritime Shipping is a global enterprise, and as such the question of jurisdiction in terms and international law and convention is critical to understanding how it is applied.

Borders
---------

United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a framework for the regulation of ocean space.

**Territorial Sea**: belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline (mean low water mark) of a coastal state. It is sovereign Territory of the state, but must allow for innocent passage through it to foreign vessels both military and civilian.

**Contiguous Zone**: Extends a further 12 nautical miles from the Territorial Waters. Limited control for punishing infringement of laws and regulations within the territory and territorial sea.

**Exclusive Economic Zone**: Extends from the baseline to a maximum of 200 nautical miles. A coastal nation has control of all economic resources within the EEZ, including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and is also responsible for pollution of those resources.

**High Seas**:
All parts of the ocean that are not part of a territorial sea, or the internal waters of a state.


Laws applying to Vessels
-------------------------

**Flag State Jurisdiction**: When vessels are on the high seas, the Flag State (the state the vessel is registered under) is responsible for the vessel and it's compliance with their laws. Flag States have right and duties to enact legislation that give them the power to enforce international convention in these matters.

**Coastal State Jurisdiction**: A coastal state has jurisdiction over it's own maritime zones, encompass the resources, activities, and external impacts upon them.

**Port State Jurisdiction**: When vessels are operating within a port foreign to their Flag State, they are subject to laws and regulations within that Port State's jurisdiction.

This is critical to a concept of 'no favourable treatment'. A Flag State can't give a vessel a competitive advantage because their country hasn't ratified new conventions, as those Flag State vessels must still comply with Port States when they are working through their ports. This can result in inspection of certificates, ships, and potential detention of the vessel if they are found to be in breach of Port State Controls.

Public and Private
-----------------------

**Public** International Law is about relationships between nations and the rules that are binding within them.

**Private** International Law is about disputes between individuals and/or businesses in situations where the laws of more than one nation may apply.
