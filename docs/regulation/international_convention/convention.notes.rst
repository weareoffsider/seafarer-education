Convention
============


United Nations
-----------------
193 member states of 195 countries (Holy See and State of Palestine are non-member observer states).

International Maritime Organisation
------------------------------------
Specialized agency for UN focussed on international shipping and to prevent pollution.

"Safe, secure and efficient shipping on clean oceans."


Universally adopted regulatory framework for the shipping industry.

80% of global trade is international shipping.

- Ship Design
- Construction
- Equipment
- Manning
- Operation
- Disposal

Normalisation is necessary for navigable laws, and rarely are maritime questions confined to a single country, and therefore there is always an international bias.

Conventions create treaty between states that they agree to apply the principles within the convention.

Law is enacted by states to give effect and force to the provisions of a convention.

Recommendations are not binding to member states, but may be implemented by states.
