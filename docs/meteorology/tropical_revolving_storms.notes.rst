Tropical Revolving Storms
===========================

Intense areas of low pressure, originating in the tropics, Force 8 or higher max wind speed.


Formation
-----------------

Instability of atmosphere, in low latitudes.

Always over sea, as the energy source is latent heat released by condensation. Western edges of oceans where trade winds carry a high sea surface temperature.

Whirling motion requires coriolis force, so the tropical front usually must be a distance from the equator (8° to 20°) to form a TRS.

Rate of movement - 15 knots max, up to 25-30 knots after recurve.
Recurve approx 25°N and 15-20°S.


Warnings
-----------
High Cirrus Clouds pointing towards storm centre.
Rapid Change in direction and strength of the wind.
Very clear atmosphere
Long swell from the stom centre.


Readings
---------------

Atmospheric Pressure fall (10hpa in 50 nm)
Wind in draft 45° to 0° at eye wall.
Visibility excellent until deteriorating due to rain and spray.
Storm surges and swells.

Location
------------
Using buy ballots laws, but instead of 90° use 12 points instead (due to stronger indraft angle).

5hPa down, eye within 200 miles.

Navigable and Non-navigable semicircle. Non-navigable quadrant.


Evasive Action
---------------

Non-navigable, approach 1-4 points off the bow.
Navigaable, keep wind on quarter to curve out of the TRS.


Categories of Cyclones
----------------------
1 to 5.

Mitigation Measures
-------------------
Anchor, Moor, Berth, or Put to Sea
Clear scuppers.
Reduce centre of gravity.
