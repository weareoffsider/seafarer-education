Tankers
==================

Tankers are vessels designed to carry liquid cargos. In an economy that relies on oil and oil products, they represent a significant share of cargo moved throughout the world, and also a significant risk for environmental damage.

Tankers are classified as either Crude Tankers, or Product Tankers. Crude Tankers carry unrefined crude oil from the point of extraction to refineries. Product Tankers carry refined products (for example petrol, kerosene, jet fuel oil) to where they are used, and often are smaller and more versatile in the carriage of different products than Crude Tankers are.

Guidance for the safe carriage and handling of oil is outlined in the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers & Terminals (ISGOTT). It provides operational advice on certain aspects of the process, especially those where an interaction between Tanker and Terminal takes place.
