Mathematical Navigation
========================

Many lines of position, and distances, can not be found by purely mechanical means. Either the chart can not be made of a practical size (for Celestial Navigation), or the distance can not be established directly without calculation (such as angles taken off of distant landmarks).

This section covers the techniques of Mathematical Navigation. Many of the techniques here are relegated to the status of 'backup' with ECDIS, or at the very least basic chart plotters with GPS feeds as navigation aids, however they are fundamental to understanding how they work, and any seafarer will need to have familiarity with these processes.
