<h1>Dangerous Goods Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#dangerous-goods-handling" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Dangerous goods as per the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code are substances and articles that have explosive, flammable, toxic, infectious or corrosive properties. As such, their carriage poses a risk to public safety, property, and the environment.</p>
<p>The IMDG Code represents international guidelines for safe transportation of dangerous goods by water on a vessel, as well as best practices for industries connected with shipping. It is mandated through Chapter VII of the SOLAS Convention, and in Australia given force through the Navigation Act 2012 and Marine Orders Part 41.</p>
<p>The two volumes of the IMDG Code, plus a Supplement, are used to obtain information and instructions for handling dangerous goods at sea, and a currently valid edition must be used.</p>
<section id="compliance-in-dangerous-goods-handling">
<h2>Compliance in Dangerous Goods Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#compliance-in-dangerous-goods-handling" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As well as following the best practices outlined in the IMDG Code for any particular Dangerous Good, it is essential that the vessel is appropriately certified. That includes the following documentation:</p>
<section id="document-of-compliance">
<h3>Document of Compliance<a class="headerlink" href="#document-of-compliance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Document of Compliance is evidence that the vessel is appropriately constructed and equipped to carry the relevant Dangerous Goods for its operational capacity. It outlines the hold spaces that are compliant for specific categories of cargo, as well as the equipment carried that is immediately relevant to this compliance, such as safety equipment, ventilation, explosion protection for ignition sources, and so on. DOCs are valid for a maximum of 5 years, and are maintained through the process of initial, annual and renewal surveys.</p>
</section>
<section id="multi-modal-dangerous-goods-form">
<h3>Multi-Modal Dangerous Goods Form<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-modal-dangerous-goods-form" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.amsa.gov.au/forms/multimodal-dangerous-goods">Multi-modal Dangerous Goods Forms</a> must be completed to notify the flag state of an intention to ship dangerous goods. This form will be completed by the shipper, and will be consolidated for the master of the shipping vessel.</p>
</section>
<section id="dangerous-goods-manifest">
<h3>Dangerous Goods Manifest<a class="headerlink" href="#dangerous-goods-manifest" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A vessel will maintain a complete manifest of all the Dangerous Goods it is planning to carry, to ensure a complete overview. This includes the identification of the goods, as well their stowage location.</p>
</section>
<section id="imdg-gode-and-inf-code">
<h3>IMDG Gode and INF Code<a class="headerlink" href="#imdg-gode-and-inf-code" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A copy of the IMDG Code must be carried, as well as a copy of the Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF) Code if the vessel is carrying Radioactive Cargos.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedures-and-drills">
<h3>Procedures and Drills<a class="headerlink" href="#procedures-and-drills" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The vessel will also have a Safety Management System that outlines any special requirements or emergency procedures not mentioned in the code, as well as evidence of training and drills for the crew.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="identifying-dangerous-goods">
<h2>Identifying Dangerous Goods<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-dangerous-goods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 9 classes of Dangerous Goods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Class 1: Explosives</p></li>
<li><p>Class 2: Gases</p></li>
<li><p>Class 3: Flammable liquids</p></li>
<li><p>Class 4: Flammable solids; substances liable to spontaneous combustion and substances which, on contact with water, emit flammable gases</p></li>
<li><p>Class 5: Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides</p></li>
<li><p>Class 6: Toxic and infectious substances</p></li>
<li><p>Class 7: Radioactive material</p></li>
<li><p>Class 8: Corrosive substances</p></li>
<li><p>Class 9: Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Among each class, the actual substances will also be identified with a United Nations number and a Proper Shipping Name.</p>
</section>
<section id="segregating-dangerous-goods">
<h2>Segregating Dangerous Goods<a class="headerlink" href="#segregating-dangerous-goods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dangerous Goods may not only be dangerous on their own merits, but in interaction with other dangerous goods. To control for this, the IMDG Code specifies segregation requirements for various classes of cargo. Horizontal separation must always be projected vertically, so for example a 3 metre separation horizontally includes all space above and below those 3 metres.</p>
<p><strong>Away from</strong>: may be carried in the same compartment or on deck, provided they are separated by <strong>3 metres horizontally</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Seperated From</strong>: can be separated in the same compartment if there is an intervening deck resistant to fire and liquids, but otherwise must be in separated holds. On deck they must be separated by 6 metres horizontally.</p>
<p><strong>Separated by a complete compartment or hold from</strong>: must be separated by a complete compartment or hold, with two bulkheads resistant to fire and liquids between them. On deck there must be 12 metres of horizontal separation, even if one of the goods is below deck.</p>
<p><strong>Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from</strong>: must be separated longitudinally by a complete compartment or hold, with on deck and under deck cargo requiring horizontal separation of 24 metres.</p>
