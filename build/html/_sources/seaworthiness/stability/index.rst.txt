Stability
=============

Stability is the study of a ship's ability to float upright. Understanding stability, and the tools of stability for watchkeeping, are essential to safe management of a vessel.

When learning stability, it's important to realise that near all concepts are interrelated. A poor understanding of any particular component will undermine your ability to work with and understand it in full.
