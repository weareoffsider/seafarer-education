Watchkeeping
============

Watchkeeping - in the context of these documents - is largely a discussion of information gathering, decision making, and execution during a vessel's passage. It is a practice which pulls together many aspects of Maritime capability - navigation, manoeuvring, meteorology, planning, among other things - and uses them to inform sound decision making and execution to keep the vessel and all it interacts with safe.
