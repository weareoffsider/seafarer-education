Regulation
===========

The entire practice of maritime shipping is subject to a wide variety of conventions, laws, and regulation, which is used to dictate best practice, the rights and responsibilities of nations, shipping organisations, the crews that operate, and individual seafarers.

This is an extremely wide ranging subject, and prolonged investigation will draw you in to long histories of change as the law attempts to resolve the myriad concerns of all who interact with the maritime industry, and the sea as a broader concept.
